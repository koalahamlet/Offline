# Offline

"#offline" is an app that asks you once a minute whether you're online or not. 
If you don't acknowledge within 10 seconds it tweets that you're offline. 
By raising awareness of the frequency with which we interact with technology, 
we hope to encourage smartphone users to take time to themselves and contemplate 
the dichotomy of virtual connection vs physical present and... Oh god what the fuck are we doing!?
